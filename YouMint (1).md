### Challenge Description
A colleague of mine wanted to learn OSINT but he was so damn old school, he could only understand dia's humint policy.  
He wanted to get recruited, but was only seeing ERROR 508. Post trial and error, he found about CAC and wanted to get recruited in the reader company instead.  
When looking at their people, at 0:23 he found a beautiful girl and decided that she is the green flag for him.
